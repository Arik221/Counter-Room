Statement Date: June 13, 1994 (Initial Interview at Rockingham Estate)
Location: 360 North Rockingham Avenue, O.J. Simpson's Estate

Before O.J. Simpson caught a late flight to Chicago on June 12, we went to McDonald's around 9:00 PM and returned home by 9:50 PM. O.J. went into the main house, and I went to my bungalow in the back guest area. Around 10:45 PM, I heard several loud banging noises outside near the bungalow's air conditioning unitâ€”like thumps on the wall. I thought it might be an earthquake. I went outside with a flashlight but saw nothing unusual. A few minutes later, a limousine arrived at the Rockingham gate for O.J.'s airport ride. O.J. emerged from the house around 11:00 PM, seemed normal but in a hurry, and left in the limo. I didn't see any blood or unusual activity.
