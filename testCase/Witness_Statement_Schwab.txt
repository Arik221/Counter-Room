Statement Date: June 13, 1994
Location: Brentwood area near 875 South Bundy Drive

On June 12, 1994, just before 11:00 PM, while walking my dog in the Brentwood neighborhood, I encountered an excited and agitated Akita dog with blood on its paws and belly. The dog was barking loudly and seemed distressed. I tried to calm it and noticed the blood was fresh and smeared. I alerted my neighbor, Sukru Boztepe, and asked if he could keep the dog until morning so we could search for its owner. The dog appeared to belong to someone nearby, as it was well-groomed but panicked.
