Statement Date: June 13, 1994
Location: 875 South Bundy Drive, Brentwood

After Steven Schwab brought the bloody Akita to me around 11:00 PM on June 12, I decided to take the dog for a walk to find its owner. Around 12:10 AM on June 13, the dog pulled me toward 875 South Bundy Drive. As we approached the front walkway, I saw a lifeless human body surrounded by a massive amount of blood. It was a woman lying face down, and next to her was another body of a man on his side, both covered in blood. The scene was horrificâ€”blood everywhere on the concrete walkway and gate area. I immediately called 911 and waited for police without touching anything.
